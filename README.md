# Euler2_Java

Problem 2 of Project Euler solved in Java 1.8 using the sequential computation approach. F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub> where F<sub>1</sub> = 1 and F<sub>2</sub> = 1.

## Project Euler Problem 2 -- Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
